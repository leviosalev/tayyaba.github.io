Hi, Iâ€™m Tayyaba. I recently graduated with a BS in Physics from LUMS (2025). I am currently a teaching assistant and work on tests of general relativity with compact binary systems. My research interests include gravitational waves, waveform modeling, parameter estimation, and exploring applications of machine learning and data science in physics and astronomy.
