Hi, I’m Tayyaba. I recently graduated with a BS in Physics from LUMS (2025). I am currently a teaching assistant and work on tests of general relativity with compact binary systems. My research explores gravitational waves, compact binaries, and the modeling of waveforms and systematics, as well as parameter estimation using Fisher information and Bayesian methods. Beyond gravitational physics, I’m also interested in cosmology, astronomy, and the use of machine learning and data science in physics research.
