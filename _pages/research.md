## Tests of General Relativity with GWFast  
*July 2025 – Present*  

I am currently working with Emanuele Berti’s group at Johns Hopkins University as part of the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix, a multi-year community effort to define the observatory’s science case. In this project, I forecast the measurability of beyond-GR deviations in binary black hole inspirals using next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. My approach relies on Fisher-matrix analyses with realistic astrophysical catalogs and waveform models that include higher harmonics. I am also implementing beyond-GR extensions in the post-Newtonian inspiral framework within the **[GWFAST](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/gwfast)** package, which will be released publicly.

## [Senior Year Project on Gravitational Waves](https://leviosalev.github.io/tayyaba-noureen-portfolio/assets/Tayyaba-Noureen-Gravitational-Waves-from-Compact-Binaries-Foundations-and-Waveform-Construction-2025.pdf)  
*July 2024 – May 2025*  

For my senior year project, I explored the theoretical foundations of gravitational waveforms from compact binary coalescences. I derived the quadrupole formula directly from the linearized Einstein equations and connected it to observations through the classic binary pulsar example. To visualize coalescence dynamics, I constructed Newtonian-limit waveforms in Maple, producing plots of strain, orbital velocity, and inspiral trajectories. I then implemented the TaylorF2 waveform model in Python within the post-Newtonian framework for quasi-circular binaries, which allowed me to assess its limitations and motivate future extensions to spin-precessing and beyond-GR models.

## [Gravitational Collapse of Spherically Symmetric Dust](https://leviosalev.github.io/tayyaba-noureen-portfolio/assets/Tayyaba_Noureen_Gravitational_Collapse.pdf)  
*Spring 2024*  

In this independent project, I studied the Oppenheimer–Snyder model of gravitational collapse. I synthesized results from several general relativity references to produce a self-consistent derivation of the collapse of a homogeneous dust sphere. I derived both the interior and exterior metric evolution, applying hypersurface matching and thin-shell junction conditions to ensure consistency. This work clarified several ambiguities in textbook treatments and helped me understand the general features of gravitational collapse in idealized settings.

## [On Decay of Bound Muons](https://leviosalev.github.io/tayyaba-noureen-portfolio/assets/Bound_Muon_Decay_25100223_and_25100114.pdf)  
*Spring 2024*  

I investigated bound muon decay as a probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. I solved the Dirac equation in a Coulomb potential to obtain the ground-state wavefunctions of bound muons and used them to compute decay rates in both relativistic and non-relativistic limits. Comparing bound and free muon decays highlighted subtle differences with possible sensitivity to new physics. This project gave me experience in bridging quantum field theory with atomic physics methods to explore precision tests of particle physics.
