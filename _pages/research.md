## Research Projects  

### Tests of General Relativity with GWFAST  
*July 2025 ‚Äì Present*  

As gravitational-wave detectors improve and next-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer are designed, it becomes increasingly important to understand how well they can test general relativity. I am contributing to this effort as part of the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix, a multi-year community project to define the observatory‚Äôs science case.
In this work, we use Fisher-matrix analyses with realistic astrophysical catalogs and waveform models that include higher harmonics to forecast the measurability of beyond-GR deviations in binary black hole inspirals. My contribution focuses on implementing beyond-GR extensions in the post-Newtonian inspiral framework within  **[GWFAST](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/gwfast)**, a fast parameter-estimation package. These implementations will be released publicly as part of the code, supporting future studies of detector design and science potential.

### üéì Senior Year Project on Gravitational Waves

*July 2024 ‚Äì May 2025*

Gravitational waves provide a unique lens into the universe, carrying information about the dynamics of compact binaries such as black holes and neutron stars. Because the signals detected on Earth are deeply buried in noise, accurate theoretical waveforms are essential for extracting astrophysical information. The post-Newtonian (PN) formalism provides an analytic description of the inspiral phase, making waveform generation fast and computationally efficient compared to fully numerical approaches.

In my senior year project, I studied the theoretical foundations of waveform construction within this PN framework. I began by deriving the quadrupole formula directly from the linearized Einstein equations and linking it to observations through the classic binary pulsar example. I then constructed Newtonian-limit waveforms in Maple, generating visualizations of strain, orbital velocity, and inspiral trajectories to illustrate coalescence dynamics. Building on this foundation, I implemented the TaylorF2 waveform model in Python for quasi-circular binaries, which allowed me to explore its limitations and identify the need for future extensions to spin-precessing and beyond-GR models.

## Course Projects  

### Exploratory Data Analysis of PakWheels Dataset

*Principles & Techniques of Data Science, Spring 2025*

I worked with a dataset of over 10,000 car listings scraped from PakWheels.com to uncover pricing and demand trends in Pakistan‚Äôs automobile market. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn), I examined engine capacity distributions, city-wise demand variations, and factors influencing resale prices. To test predictive performance, I built regression and decision-tree models that achieved ~85% accuracy in predicting car prices. I also experimented with feature engineering and techniques for handling missing and categorical data.

This project gave me a practical space to experiment with data-driven methods, sharpen my computational skills, and see how machine learning can be applied to real-world markets.

### Gravitational Collapse of Spherically Symmetric Dust

*General Relativity, Spring 2024*

I studied the Oppenheimer‚ÄìSnyder model of gravitational collapse, synthesizing results from several references to produce a self-consistent derivation of the collapse of a homogeneous dust sphere. I derived both the interior and exterior metric evolution, applying hypersurface matching and thin-shell junction conditions to ensure consistency.

Although highly idealized, this ‚Äúdust collapse‚Äù model is analytically solvable and captures universal features of gravitational collapse: the emergence of singularities, the formation of horizons, and the fact that distant observers see collapse freeze at the horizon. Its simplicity makes it a powerful way to build intuition for more general and realistic collapse scenarios.

### On Decay of Bound Muons

*Introduction to Quantum Field Theory, Spring 2024*

Bound muon decay provides a sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, since even small deviations from free decay rates could signal new interactions. In this project, I solved the Dirac equation in a Coulomb potential to obtain the ground-state wavefunctions of bound muons and used them to compute decay rates in both relativistic and non-relativistic limits. Comparing bound and free muon decays highlighted subtle differences that could be exploited in precision tests of particle physics.

###  Optical Pumping: Lasers and Masers

*Quantum Mechanics II, Spring 2023*

Lasers and masers rely on the controlled interaction between matter and radiation, where resonance and population inversion drive coherent emission. For this project, I explored the physics of two-level systems using time-dependent perturbation theory and analyzed the roles of spontaneous and stimulated emission. I derived Einstein‚Äôs coefficients, studied single-mode resonances, and modeled optical pumping in an active medium. This work linked abstract quantum mechanics to the practical mechanisms that make lasers and masers possible.

### Landau Theory of Fermi Liquids

*Magnetism: Theory & Experiment, Fall 2024*

Landau‚Äôs theory of Fermi liquids provides the foundation for understanding interacting electron systems in condensed matter, extending the ideal Fermi gas picture to include quasiparticle interactions. In this project, I studied how quasiparticles emerge as dressed excitations with modified effective mass and lifetime. I derived the effective mass relation from Galilean invariance, and calculated measurable properties such as heat capacity, compressibility, and magnetic susceptibility in terms of Landau parameters. This strengthened both my conceptual and technical grasp of many-body physics, showing how Fermi liquids smoothly evolve from the non-interacting case without a phase transition.
