At LUMS (2023–present), I have worked as a teaching assistant for several physics and mathematics courses, including PHYS 101 Mechanics (current), PHYS 312 Relativistic Electrodynamics, PHYS 102 Modern Physics, PHYS 212 Electricity & Magnetism, MATH 120 Linear Algebra, and MATH 101 Calculus. My responsibilities have included running tutorials, holding office hours, grading, and preparing solution sets. I have also used simulations, explainer videos, and online tools to help students engage more effectively with the material.

In July 2025, I assisted with the Quantum Mechanics Refresher Course at the National Centre for Physics, a program for physics lecturers from across Pakistan. I supported rotating instructors, coordinated assessments, and provided structured guidance to participants.

Earlier, as part of the National Outreach Program (2023), I taught high-school students from diverse backgrounds, introducing them to symmetries, quantum mechanics, and relativity. I explained how symmetry underpins many key physics theories, and introduced students to chaos theory and quantum mechanics as ways of dealing with uncertainty and irregularity. 

Teaching has also deepened my own knowledge. Students’ questions often pushed me to think more carefully, refine my explanations, and adapt the level of rigor from higher-level physics courses to simplified math and notation for high-school students.
